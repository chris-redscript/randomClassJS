# randomClassJS
A jQuery plugin that generates randomly numbered classes and applies them to a set of elements

## Basic Usage
First, include jQuery and randomClass at the end of your HTML document
```
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.3/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script src="jquery.randomClass.js"></script>
```

[Check Out This Usage Example!](http://cjthedizzy.github.io/randomClass_ex/)

Then implement as follows:
```
<script type="text/javascript">
$('.box').randomClass();
</script>
```
This will take all elements with the class "box" from the DOM and assign them a class of "randomClass$" ("$" represent the random number). 

The numbers will range from 0 to the total number of elements retrived. So 8 elements means each element with receive a random class from 0-7, no numbers will be repeated.

## Available Options
The default options are as follows:
```
$('.box').randomClass({
	count: 0, //int
	repeat: false, //bool
	customClass: "randomClass", //string
	customArray:[], //array
	after: function(){} //function
});
```

### count
Setting *count* will allow you to set a number of possible classes. So for instance you have 10 elements but you want to randomize through 20 classes, set *count: 20*. 

*Setting a count lower than the number of elements returned from the class with result in the default count being used.*

### repeat
Setting *repeat* to *true* will allow repeat classes to be generated rather than only allowing each class once

### customClass
This accepts a string to replace the default class of "randomClass" with.

### customArray
This accepts an array of class names rather than using the randomized numbered classes. If the array has enough class names to be used once for the number of elements returned, nothing will repeat. If there are less class names than elements, it will repeat.

### after
This accepts a function that fires after the classes have been added



**A Thanks to Ian Wright for writing something similar and giving me the idea to plugin-ize it.**
